The goal of this lab is to learn how to use YOLO ([Redmon et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02640)) deep learning framework for object detection and localization.  Specifically, we will use YOLO to detect road signs in [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/road-sign-detection).  

YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a real-time object detection algorithm that processes images in a single pass, predicting both bounding boxes and class probabilities (Figure 1).
